                    <p>Hi I'm Betsabé, my work combines web development, visual design, and user experience. </p>
                    <p>
                        Graduated as an Architect, and having worked for several years in the field and in different 
                        countries, in 2020 I decided to take a break in my career to focus on an area that has always 
                        interested me, web development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am interested in frontend development and the design of functional,
                        clean and user friendly interfaces
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That is why I studied web development with OpenClassrooms in France, where I had the opportunity to carry
                        out challenging projects, wich has helped me to increase my skills. 
                        In parallel I studied a Master's degree in Experience Design thanks to Shifta by Elisava, 
                        where I learned to have a global vision in the development of digital projects, and to understand the importance of the user as the center of product.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My main motivation is to continue developing my skills in the frontend area, and interaction design.
                    </p>
